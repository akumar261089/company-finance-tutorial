### **Module 4: Key Financial Ratios and Their Interpretation**

In this module, we will explore **Key Financial Ratios**, which are critical tools for evaluating a company's financial health. We will cover ratios in four main categories: **Liquidity**, **Profitability**, **Efficiency**, and **Solvency**. For each category, we will explain their significance, how they are calculated, their positive and negative implications, and provide examples using the **State Bank of India (SBI)**. By understanding these ratios, you will be better equipped to assess the financial strength and performance of any company.

#### **4.1 Liquidity Ratios**

Liquidity ratios measure a company’s ability to meet its short-term obligations using its short-term assets. These ratios are important for understanding the company’s financial flexibility and short-term financial health.

**Key Liquidity Ratios:**

1. **Current Ratio:**

   - **Formula:** Current Ratio = Current Assets / Current Liabilities
   - **Definition:** This ratio shows the ability of the company to cover its short-term liabilities with its short-term assets.
   - **Positive Impacts:**
     - A **high current ratio** indicates that the company has sufficient assets to meet its short-term obligations, which increases its financial stability.
   - **Negative Impacts:**
     - A **too high ratio** (say, above 3) could suggest inefficiency in utilizing assets, as it may indicate excess cash or inventory not being used effectively.
   - **Example from SBI:**
     - SBI’s **Current Ratio** is generally strong due to high customer deposits, which form a large portion of the bank’s current liabilities and assets. This provides the bank ample liquidity for daily operations.

2. **Quick Ratio (Acid-Test Ratio):**
   - **Formula:** Quick Ratio = (Current Assets - Inventory) / Current Liabilities
   - **Definition:** This is a more stringent version of the current ratio, excluding inventories from assets as they may not be as easily converted to cash.
   - **Positive Impacts:**
     - A **higher quick ratio** indicates that the company has enough liquid assets (like cash and receivables) to cover its short-term liabilities, even without relying on inventory.
   - **Negative Impacts:**
     - If the ratio is too high, it may indicate that the company is not utilizing its assets efficiently to generate revenue.
   - **Example from SBI:**
     - For SBI, the quick ratio is typically strong, reflecting its reliance on liquid assets like cash and government securities rather than inventory.

**Relative Significance:**

- For banks like SBI, liquidity ratios are extremely important. A high current and quick ratio suggests the bank can meet withdrawal demands and daily operational needs without liquidity crises.

#### **4.2 Profitability Ratios**

Profitability ratios measure how efficiently a company generates profit from its resources, such as assets and equity.

1. **Return on Assets (RoA):**

   - **Formula:** RoA = Net Income / Total Assets
   - **Definition:** This ratio measures how efficiently the company uses its assets to generate profit.
   - **Positive Impacts:**
     - A **high RoA** indicates that the company is effectively using its assets to generate income.
   - **Negative Impacts:**
     - A **low RoA** could suggest poor asset management or underutilization of the company’s resources.
   - **Example from SBI:**
     - **RoA for SBI in 2023-24:** 1.04%. This reflects how efficiently SBI has used its assets (primarily loans and investments) to generate profit.

2. **Return on Equity (RoE):**
   - **Formula:** RoE = Net Income / Shareholders' Equity
   - **Definition:** RoE measures the return generated on shareholders’ equity, showing how well the company is using the money invested by its shareholders.
   - **Positive Impacts:**
     - A **high RoE** indicates the company is effectively using shareholder capital to generate profits.
   - **Negative Impacts:**
     - A **very high RoE** could indicate that the company is taking on excessive risk or using financial leverage to boost returns.
   - **Example from SBI:**
     - **RoE for SBI in 2023-24:** 20.32%. This reflects SBI’s strong ability to generate returns for its shareholders, signifying a healthy and profitable bank.

**Relative Significance:**

- For SBI, both RoA and RoE are critical measures of profitability. While RoA shows asset utilization, RoE reflects the bank's ability to provide value to its shareholders.

#### **4.3 Efficiency Ratios**

Efficiency ratios assess how well the company uses its resources to generate revenue.

1. **Asset Turnover Ratio:**

   - **Formula:** Asset Turnover = Revenue / Total Assets
   - **Definition:** This ratio shows how effectively a company uses its assets to generate revenue.
   - **Positive Impacts:**
     - A **high asset turnover ratio** indicates that the company is effectively utilizing its assets to generate revenue.
   - **Negative Impacts:**
     - A **low ratio** could indicate underutilization of assets or inefficiency in generating sales.
   - **Example from SBI:**
     - While **Asset Turnover** is not a major focus for banks like SBI (since banks are asset-heavy institutions), analyzing this ratio can provide insights into how efficiently the bank’s assets are generating income.

2. **Loan to Deposit Ratio (LDR):**
   - **Formula:** LDR = Total Loans / Total Deposits
   - **Definition:** This ratio indicates how well the bank is using its deposits to generate loans.
   - **Positive Impacts:**
     - A **higher LDR** means that the bank is lending a larger proportion of its deposits, which can indicate efficient use of funds to generate income.
   - **Negative Impacts:**
     - If the LDR is **too high**, it could suggest that the bank is over-leveraging, which may expose it to more risk.
   - **Example from SBI:**
     - **Loan to Deposit Ratio** of SBI reflects its ability to lend out deposits efficiently. As of FY 2023-24, SBI had a **LDR of 75-80%**, indicating a healthy balance between lending and maintaining liquidity.

**Relative Significance:**

- For banks, efficiency ratios like **Loan to Deposit** are more critical than traditional asset turnover ratios, as they directly relate to the bank’s lending operations, which is the core business for institutions like SBI.

#### **4.4 Solvency Ratios**

Solvency ratios assess the company’s ability to meet its long-term debt obligations, which is crucial for long-term stability.

1. **Debt to Equity Ratio:**

   - **Formula:** Debt to Equity = Total Debt / Shareholder’s Equity
   - **Definition:** This ratio shows the proportion of debt used to finance the company’s operations in relation to shareholders' equity.
   - **Positive Impacts:**
     - A **low debt to equity ratio** indicates that the company is less reliant on debt for financing, which lowers financial risk.
   - **Negative Impacts:**
     - A **high ratio** indicates higher financial leverage, which increases risk, especially if the company faces cash flow problems.
   - **Example from SBI:**
     - SBI’s **Debt to Equity Ratio** is typically low, as the bank is primarily funded by customer deposits, which are considered less risky than long-term debt.

2. **Capital Adequacy Ratio (CAR):**
   - **Formula:** CAR = (Tier 1 Capital + Tier 2 Capital) / Risk-Weighted Assets
   - **Definition:** CAR is a regulatory measure of a bank’s ability to absorb financial shocks and continue operating during periods of financial stress.
   - **Positive Impacts:**
     - A **high CAR** means that the bank has a strong capital buffer, which is critical for stability in times of economic stress.
   - **Negative Impacts:**
     - A **too high CAR** might indicate inefficiency, as it suggests that the bank may not be fully utilizing its capital to generate returns.
   - **Example from SBI:**
     - **CAR for SBI in 2023-24:** 14.28%. This shows that SBI has a solid capital base, exceeding the regulatory requirement of 11.5%, making it well-capitalized to absorb shocks.

**Relative Significance:**

- For banks like SBI, **solvency ratios** are vital for regulatory compliance and ensuring long-term stability. A strong CAR is a positive sign for investors and regulators, reflecting the bank’s ability to withstand financial distress.
