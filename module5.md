### **Module 5: Cash Flow Statement Analysis**

A **Cash Flow Statement (CFS)** provides a detailed analysis of the cash inflows and outflows of a company during a specific period. Unlike the income statement, which includes non-cash items such as depreciation, the cash flow statement focuses solely on actual cash transactions. This helps to understand how well the company manages its cash position and how it funds its operations, investments, and financing activities.

In this module, we will break down the three primary sections of the Cash Flow Statement:

1. **Operating Activities**
2. **Investing Activities**
3. **Financing Activities**

We will also look at examples from **State Bank of India (SBI)** to demonstrate how these sections apply in a real-world context.

#### **5.1 Operating Activities**

**Cash Flows from Core Business Operations** represent the cash generated or spent during the bank’s core operations, such as lending, deposit collection, and service fees. This section is crucial as it shows how much cash a business generates from its primary activities, independent of investment and financing decisions.

**Key Elements:**

- **Inflows:** Cash generated from customers through loans, deposits, interest on loans, service fees, etc.
- **Outflows:** Payments to suppliers, wages, taxes, and interest payments on borrowings.

**Positive Impacts:**

- A **positive cash flow** from operating activities indicates that the company can generate sufficient cash from its core operations to cover expenses and reinvest in the business.
- **Stable operating cash flows** demonstrate strong financial health and are essential for long-term sustainability.

**Negative Impacts:**

- **Negative cash flow** from operations can indicate problems with the core business model, possibly arising from low sales, high operational costs, or inefficiency in collections.
- **Frequent negative operating cash flow** signals that the company may be overly reliant on external financing, which could be unsustainable in the long term.

**Example from SBI:**

- **Interest Payments:** SBI generates cash inflows from the interest on loans issued to customers. Simultaneously, it makes outflows in the form of interest payments on borrowings, such as bonds or other forms of debt.

**Relative Significance:**

- For a bank like SBI, operating activities are the most critical section of the cash flow statement because a bank’s primary source of cash inflow is its lending and deposit operations. Positive cash flow from operations indicates the bank's ability to sustain its day-to-day activities.

#### **5.2 Investing Activities**

**Cash Flows from Investments** refer to the cash spent or received from buying or selling investments, such as securities, real estate, or fixed assets. This section reveals how a company is using its available cash to expand, acquire new assets, or divest existing ones.

**Key Elements:**

- **Inflows:** Cash received from selling investments, bonds, or property.
- **Outflows:** Cash spent on purchasing investments or acquiring property, equipment, or other assets.

**Positive Impacts:**

- **Positive cash flow** from investing activities can indicate that the company is generating returns from its investments or divesting non-essential assets to focus on core operations.
- **Prudent investing** leads to the growth of the company’s capital base, improving long-term profitability.

**Negative Impacts:**

- **Negative cash flow** from investing activities typically arises when the company is making significant capital expenditures (CapEx) or investments that may not pay off immediately.
- **Excessive negative investing cash flow** could indicate over-expansion, which may not align with the company’s short-term cash position.

**Example from SBI:**

- **Government Bonds and Corporate Securities:** SBI often purchases government bonds and corporate securities as part of its investment strategy. These investments provide a steady stream of income and help manage liquidity.
- **Asset Sales or Purchases:** SBI may sell non-core assets (such as real estate) or purchase new technology and equipment to enhance its operations.

**Relative Significance:**

- For banks like SBI, the investing section of the cash flow statement shows how the bank is managing its assets and investments. While some capital expenditures are necessary for growth, significant negative cash flow in investing activities can raise concerns about misallocation of resources.

#### **5.3 Financing Activities**

**Cash Flows from Borrowings and Equity** involve cash inflows and outflows related to obtaining and repaying funds through debt or equity. This section is crucial for understanding how the company raises capital and manages its debt.

**Key Elements:**

- **Inflows:** Cash received from issuing shares or bonds, borrowing loans, or other financing activities.
- **Outflows:** Payments related to repaying debt, dividend payments, and buying back stock.

**Positive Impacts:**

- **Positive cash flow** from financing activities indicates the company has raised funds through debt or equity to finance its operations or investments.
- **Prudent financing** decisions can help fuel growth without overleveraging the company.

**Negative Impacts:**

- **Excessive reliance on debt** leading to frequent negative financing cash flow could indicate over-leveraging, which might affect the company’s financial stability.
- **Negative cash flow** from financing activities due to debt repayments or dividend payouts is common in mature companies but must be managed properly.

**Example from SBI:**

- **Issuance of Bonds or Equity:** SBI raises funds by issuing bonds or equity shares to the public or institutional investors. These funds help the bank finance its operations, meet regulatory capital requirements, and invest in new opportunities.
- **Repayments and Dividends:** Cash outflows include repayments on bonds, loans, or dividends to shareholders.

**Relative Significance:**

- For SBI, financing activities are significant as banks frequently issue bonds or raise capital to meet regulatory capital adequacy requirements. However, the focus should be on maintaining a balance between debt and equity to ensure the bank does not become over-leveraged.

### **Exercise:**

**Review SBI’s Cash Flow Statement from the most recent financial year and answer the following questions:**

1. **How much cash did SBI generate from its operating activities?**
   - Look for net cash provided by operating activities.
   - Assess whether the bank is generating enough cash from its core operations to cover expenses and reinvest in the business.
2. **What was the cash flow from investing activities?**
   - Identify any significant purchases or sales of securities or assets.
   - Determine if SBI is investing heavily in long-term growth or divesting non-core assets.
3. **How much cash did SBI raise from financing activities?**

   - Examine the inflows from issuing bonds, equity, or borrowing.
   - Analyze the outflows for debt repayments or dividends to shareholders.

4. **Overall, what is the proportion of cash generated from operating activities versus financing activities?**
   - Compare cash flows from operations with financing and investing activities. This will give insight into whether the bank is self-sustaining or dependent on external sources of funds.

### **Conclusion of Module 5**

In this module, we explored the three major sections of the **Cash Flow Statement**: **Operating Activities**, **Investing Activities**, and **Financing Activities**. Each section plays a critical role in understanding the company’s cash generation, usage, and financing strategies.

- **Operating activities** are the lifeblood of the company, as they show whether the company is generating enough cash from its core operations to sustain its activities.
- **Investing activities** reflect how the company is allocating capital to grow its business, acquire assets, and generate future returns.
- **Financing activities** give insights into how the company raises capital, whether through debt or equity, and how it manages debt repayment and dividend distribution.

By analyzing these sections, you can better understand a company’s financial stability and performance. For a large bank like SBI, managing these cash flows efficiently is crucial for sustaining its operations, ensuring liquidity, and maintaining investor confidence.
