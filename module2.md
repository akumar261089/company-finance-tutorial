### **Module 2: Understanding the Balance Sheet**

The balance sheet is one of the key financial statements of a company, providing a snapshot of its financial position at a specific point in time. It is based on the **accounting equation**:  
**Assets = Liabilities + Shareholders' Equity**.  
This module will explore the components of the balance sheet in detail, focusing on assets, liabilities, and equity, and using **State Bank of India (SBI)** as an example to provide practical insights.

#### **2.1 Assets**

**Definition:** Assets are resources owned by the company that are expected to bring future economic benefits. Assets can be classified into **current assets** and **non-current assets**.

##### **2.1.1 Current Assets**

- **Definition:** Current assets are assets that are expected to be converted into cash, sold, or consumed within one year or within the company’s normal operating cycle (whichever is longer).
- **Examples:**
  - **Cash and Cash Equivalents:** Money in hand and in bank accounts.
  - **Accounts Receivable:** Money owed to the company by customers.
  - **Inventory:** Goods held for sale.

**Example from SBI:**

- **Cash and Cash Equivalents:** In SBI’s balance sheet, this includes the bank’s cash reserves and funds held at the central bank, which totaled ₹3,58,693 Crore in 2023-24.
- **Accounts Receivable:** This could include amounts owed by other financial institutions or corporates that have taken loans from SBI.

##### **2.1.2 Non-Current Assets**

- **Definition:** Non-current assets are assets that are expected to provide economic benefits over a period longer than one year.
- **Examples:**
  - **Property, Plant, and Equipment (PPE):** Land, buildings, and machinery.
  - **Investments:** Stocks, bonds, and other securities the company holds for the long term.
  - **Intangible Assets:** Non-physical assets like trademarks or patents.

**Example from SBI:**

- **Loans and Advances (Non-Current Asset):** As of 2023-24, SBI’s loan book stood at ₹37,03,971 Crore, representing its largest asset category. These are long-term loans to corporate clients, businesses, and individuals, which are expected to generate interest income over time.
- **Investments:** SBI’s investments in government bonds and corporate bonds make up a significant portion of its non-current assets.

##### **Positive Impacts of Non-Current Assets:**

- **Revenue Generation:** Non-current assets like loans and investments generate consistent income for the bank (e.g., interest on loans).
- **Long-Term Growth:** These assets can appreciate over time, providing capital gains.

##### **Negative Impacts:**

- **Liquidity Risks:** Non-current assets like long-term loans are less liquid and harder to sell or convert to cash quickly.
- **Depreciation/Amortization:** Some non-current assets (like physical property or intangible assets) may lose value over time.

##### **Relative Significance:**

- Non-current assets are crucial for SBI's operations, as they drive interest income and future growth. However, they are less liquid than current assets and cannot be easily converted into cash if the bank needs funds urgently.

#### **2.2 Liabilities**

**Definition:** Liabilities are obligations of the company that arise from past events, which will result in an outflow of resources (usually cash) to settle the obligations.

##### **2.2.1 Current Liabilities**

- **Definition:** Current liabilities are obligations that the company needs to settle within one year.
- **Examples:**
  - **Accounts Payable:** Money owed to suppliers or creditors.
  - **Short-Term Borrowings:** Loans and borrowings due for repayment within one year.
  - **Other Short-Term Liabilities:** Taxes payable, accrued expenses, etc.

**Example from SBI:**

- **Customer Deposits:** These are the largest category of liabilities for SBI. As of 2023-24, customer deposits amounted to ₹49,16,077 Crore. These are funds that SBI holds on behalf of its customers and are required to be returned upon demand.
- **Short-Term Borrowings:** SBI’s short-term borrowings come from the central bank and other financial institutions.

##### **2.2.2 Non-Current Liabilities**

- **Definition:** Non-current liabilities are long-term financial obligations that the company will settle in over one year.
- **Examples:**
  - **Long-Term Borrowings:** Loans or bonds with a maturity of more than one year.
  - **Deferred Tax Liabilities:** Taxes owed but not yet due for payment.
  - **Other Long-Term Liabilities:** Provisions for pensions, employee benefits, etc.

**Example from SBI:**

- **Long-Term Borrowings:** SBI’s non-current liabilities include bonds and long-term loans it issues to finance its operations. In 2023-24, SBI’s long-term borrowings stood at ₹5,97,561 Crore.

##### **Positive Impacts of Liabilities:**

- **Leverage for Growth:** Liabilities like customer deposits enable SBI to lend money and generate interest income, which is the primary way the bank makes money.
- **Capital for Investment:** Long-term borrowings provide capital for expanding operations and funding new projects without needing to rely solely on equity.

##### **Negative Impacts:**

- **Debt Servicing Costs:** Interest payments on liabilities like borrowings can reduce profitability, especially if the bank has high debt.
- **Liquidity Risk:** Too many short-term liabilities could pose liquidity issues if the bank cannot meet these obligations with available cash.

##### **Relative Significance:**

- Liabilities are significant for SBI's growth strategy as they provide funds for lending and investments. However, managing the balance between short-term and long-term liabilities is crucial to avoid liquidity problems.

#### **2.3 Shareholder Equity**

**Definition:** Shareholder equity represents the residual interest in the assets of the company after deducting liabilities. It shows what the company owes to its shareholders.

##### **2.3.1 Components of Equity**

- **Share Capital:** The amount invested by the shareholders in the company.
- **Reserves and Surplus:** Profits retained in the business after paying dividends. This includes accumulated profits, retained earnings, and other reserves.

**Example from SBI:**

- **Share Capital:** SBI has a large equity base with a considerable amount of capital invested by the government of India (its largest shareholder) and other investors.
- **Reserves and Surplus:** In 2023-24, SBI reported ₹3,76,354 Crore in reserves and surplus, representing retained earnings and capital reserves accumulated over time.

##### **Positive Impacts of Shareholder Equity:**

- **Financial Stability:** A high level of equity indicates a strong financial position and can make it easier for SBI to raise additional funds or weather economic downturns.
- **Low Debt Dependence:** A strong equity base reduces the reliance on debt financing, lowering the financial risk.

##### **Negative Impacts:**

- **Cost of Equity:** Raising equity capital can be expensive for the company in the form of dividends, compared to debt which has fixed interest payments.
- **Dilution of Control:** Issuing new shares can dilute the ownership stake of existing shareholders.

##### **Relative Significance:**

- Equity is a critical measure of financial health for SBI. A large equity base helps SBI absorb potential losses and maintain solvency, while its profitability is often linked to the ability to retain earnings in the form of reserves.

### **Conclusion of Module 2**

The **Balance Sheet** provides a detailed view of a company's financial position. By analyzing **assets**, **liabilities**, and **shareholder equity**, we can gain insights into a company’s ability to generate income, manage its debts, and fund future growth.

**Key Takeaways:**

- **Assets** are resources that generate future income but have varying degrees of liquidity.
- **Liabilities** represent the company’s obligations, and their management is crucial to ensure smooth financial operations.
- **Shareholder equity** shows the value of the company owned by shareholders and reflects the overall financial health of the institution.

In the case of **State Bank of India (SBI)**, its large asset base primarily made up of loans and advances, significant liabilities in the form of customer deposits, and substantial reserves and surplus provide it with both financial stability and growth potential.

**Exercise:** Review SBI's balance sheet for the past 3 years and calculate the following ratios:

- **Current Ratio**
- **Quick Ratio**
- **Debt to Equity Ratio**
- **Return on Assets (RoA)**
- **Return on Equity (RoE)**

This will help you assess SBI’s liquidity, profitability, and solvency over time.
