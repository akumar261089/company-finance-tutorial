### **Module 6: Financial Performance and Valuation**

This module will help you understand key performance metrics and valuation methods used to assess the financial health and value of a company. By the end of this module, you will be able to interpret key financial performance indicators and apply valuation techniques to gauge the worth of a company like **State Bank of India (SBI)**.

#### **6.1 Performance Metrics**

Performance metrics help evaluate how well a company is performing in terms of profitability, valuation, and shareholder value. They are important tools for investors and analysts to assess the financial health of a company and make informed investment decisions.

**Earnings Per Share (EPS)**

EPS is a measure of a company's profitability on a per-share basis. It is calculated by dividing the net profit by the number of outstanding shares. EPS provides a quick way to gauge how much profit a company is generating for each share of stock, making it a key performance metric for investors.

**Formula:**

\[
\text{EPS} = \frac{\text{Net Profit}}{\text{Outstanding Shares}}
\]

**Positive Impacts:**

- **Higher EPS** typically indicates better profitability and is viewed positively by investors.
- **Growth in EPS** over time signals strong financial health and effective management.

**Negative Impacts:**

- **Declining EPS** over time may indicate shrinking profits, inefficiency, or adverse external factors.
- **Low or negative EPS** can make the company less attractive to investors, as it may signal financial instability.

**Example from SBI:**

- **EPS for SBI**: If SBI reports a net profit of ₹10,000 Crore with 1,000 Crore shares outstanding, its EPS will be ₹10.
- A higher EPS would indicate that SBI is effectively generating profit for its shareholders.

**Price-to-Earnings (P/E) Ratio**

The **P/E Ratio** is a valuation ratio used to compare a company’s current share price to its per-share earnings. It indicates whether the stock is overvalued or undervalued compared to its earnings.

**Formula:**

\[
\text{P/E Ratio} = \frac{\text{Market Price per Share}}{\text{EPS}}
\]

**Positive Impacts:**

- A **low P/E ratio** can indicate that a stock is undervalued, potentially presenting a buying opportunity if the company’s prospects remain strong.
- A **high P/E ratio** suggests high investor expectations for future growth, which could be a sign of a premium valuation.

**Negative Impacts:**

- A **high P/E ratio** could indicate that a stock is overvalued relative to its earnings, leading to potential correction if growth fails to meet expectations.
- A **low P/E ratio** may suggest that the company is facing difficulties, or investors are pessimistic about its future performance.

**Example from SBI:**

- If SBI's stock price is ₹300 and its EPS is ₹10, the P/E ratio will be 30 (300/10).
- A P/E ratio of 30 implies that investors are willing to pay 30 times the company's earnings for each share. Comparing this with competitors like **HDFC Bank**, **ICICI Bank**, and **Axis Bank** can give you a sense of whether SBI is overvalued or undervalued.

#### **6.2 Valuation Methods**

Valuation methods help estimate the intrinsic value of a company or stock by considering various financial metrics and projections. These methods assist investors in making decisions about whether a stock is fairly priced, overvalued, or undervalued.

---

**Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) Method**

The **DCF method** is used to determine the value of a company based on the present value of its future cash flows. These future cash flows are projected and then discounted to the present using a discount rate (typically the company’s cost of capital or a required rate of return). The DCF method is widely used because it takes into account the company's long-term growth and future potential.

**Formula:**

\[
\text{DCF Value} = \sum \left( \frac{\text{Future Cash Flows}}{(1 + r)^n} \right)
\]

Where:

- \( r \) = discount rate (cost of capital)
- \( n \) = number of periods in the future

**Positive Impacts:**

- **Accurate intrinsic value**: DCF gives a detailed estimate of a company’s value, considering its future growth potential and cash-generating capacity.
- **Long-term perspective**: It focuses on future cash flows, making it useful for companies with stable, predictable growth.

**Negative Impacts:**

- **Sensitive to assumptions**: The DCF method is highly sensitive to assumptions like growth rates and discount rates, which can lead to significant variation in results.
- **Requires accurate forecasting**: If the company has unpredictable cash flows or fluctuating growth, the DCF method may not provide reliable results.

**Example from SBI:**

- Suppose SBI's expected free cash flow for the next year is ₹12,000 Crore, with a growth rate of 5% and a discount rate of 10%. Using these values, you can calculate the present value of future cash flows for several years to arrive at an intrinsic value.

---

**Market Comparison Method**

This method involves comparing the financial performance of a company with its industry peers. By comparing ratios such as P/E, Price-to-Book (P/B), and other metrics, investors can determine whether a stock is undervalued or overvalued relative to its competitors.

**Positive Impacts:**

- **Quick comparison**: The market comparison method allows investors to compare companies within the same industry or sector.
- **Benchmarking**: Provides a way to assess relative performance, highlighting which companies are performing better or worse.

**Negative Impacts:**

- **Lack of uniqueness**: This method assumes that companies in the same sector or industry are comparable, which may not always be true, especially for companies with different business models or growth potential.
- **Market sentiment**: Comparisons are subject to market sentiment and may not reflect the true value of a company.

**Example from SBI:**

- Comparing SBI's **P/E ratio** with **HDFC Bank** and **ICICI Bank** will help you understand how the market values SBI relative to its peers.
  - If SBI’s P/E is significantly lower than that of **ICICI Bank** or **HDFC Bank**, it could suggest that SBI is undervalued or that investors have lower expectations for its growth.

---

### **Exercise:**

- **Step 1: Estimate SBI’s intrinsic value using the DCF method.**
  - Project SBI's future free cash flows for the next 5 years (based on historical trends, market forecasts, etc.).
  - Apply a discount rate (for example, 10%) and calculate the present value of these cash flows.
  - Sum these values to get the total intrinsic value of the company.
- **Step 2: Compare SBI’s performance with its competitors (HDFC Bank, ICICI Bank, and Axis Bank) using the P/E ratio and other relevant performance metrics.**
  - Calculate the P/E ratio for each bank.
  - Analyze whether SBI’s stock is overvalued or undervalued compared to its competitors.

### **Conclusion of Module 6**

In this module, we covered two key aspects of financial performance and valuation: **performance metrics** and **valuation methods**. By understanding metrics like **EPS** and **P/E ratios**, and applying valuation methods like **DCF** and **Market Comparison**, you can assess the true value of a company and its stock. These tools are essential for making informed investment decisions and understanding how the market values a company like SBI relative to its competitors.

Using these metrics and methods in combination with historical and future financial data can help you gain a deeper understanding of a company’s financial health and long-term prospects.
